# HactoberFest_2022
Hello, connections!

I'm happy to let you know that I've been researching open source as well. I'm delighted I tried Hactoberfest as a starting step on this journey.

As a result of wondering, "How do I even start with open source?" What exactly is open source? The motivation behind compiling 4 successful PRs was Hactoberfest 2022.

It was enjoyable to discover new repositories and make helpful contributions to them.

I have Hactoberfest and Holopin badges to post on my Github profile. Click on the following link to view those badges:
